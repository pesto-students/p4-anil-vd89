## Problem 6.6 : 3 sum

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.Return the sum of the three integers.Assume that there will only be one solution

Example: 

given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1. The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)

### Assignment Introduction:

 * Calculate the time and space complexity for the set of questions
 * A set of  Problem statement based on array that would help student how to iterate and process an array
 
### Benchmarks
 * All the problem should have an optimize solutions
 * All the problem statement should have the time and space complexity mention in the code comment
 * The code should be readable and must follow good coding practice.
 * Keep the code as modular as you can.
